-CAN DUPLICATE ORDER, NO BOOKING FAILED MESSAGE
-DESPITE OTHER ACCESSABLE PAGES FOR CAR WORKING PROPERLY, THE BOOKING LISTING IN THE ADMIN PAGES SHOW WRONG CAR WITH WRONG NAME AND ALMOST WRONG EVERYTHING BUT THE RIGHT PRICE (THE BOOKINGS.JSON DID GOT WRITTEN BY THE SCRIPT, YOU CAN CHECK IT OUT BY YOURSELF)
-UNSTABLE DELETE CAR HANDLING, SOMETIMES WORK, SOMETIME DON'T
-ANY MODIFICATION RELATE TO DELETE CAR WILL SCREW UP THE INDEX.PHP. BE SURE TO TEST EVERY FEATURE FIRST BEFORE ATTEMPT TO DO ANYTHING WITH DELETING CAR (IF IT WORKS LOL)
-BOOKING NOT WORKING FOR USER BUT I'M TIRED BOSS :(
-ACCIDENTALLY CREATE SPACE-TIME CONTINUUM UNSTABILITY, SENT 12 HOMELESS PEOPLE DWELLING IN BLAHA LUJZA BACK TO TRIASSIC PERIOD, HOPE THEY SURVIVED THE DINOSAURS
